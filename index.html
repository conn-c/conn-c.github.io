hi chai

i wanted to give you an update on how ive been doing, a bunch of stuff is changing for me and i think youd appreciate if i keep you informed

im doing alright, the main thing is i finally got a job, i should be working roughly two 8 hour shifts a week but its very irregular

i put the rest in a little website, you really dont have to read it, i wont assume youve seen any of it and theres nothing for you to respond to, its just information in case youre interested

youre very important to me

take care alright

<span class="right top-2"><span class="bold inverse">March 19th</span></span>



<div class="top-1">
<span class="top-1 bot-1 bold accent">hi chai</span>
<span class="bot-2">you really dont have to read this, i dont want to bother you, theres nothing to worry about, it doesnt concern you, im just detailing my situation

i havent much done that before and idk if youd like me to, im just putting it out here, giving you the option, its up to you what you do with it
</span>
</div>



<div>
<input type=checkbox id=check-a />
<label for=check-a class="large top-1 bot-1 bold inverse">work</label>
<span class="toggle bot-2">its a mess right now, i applied to a lot of places the past month, i got accepted to a few but they didnt give me any shifts so i kept applying, now its all happening at once and ive got way too many offers

im working as a student, students get 600 hours of work a year, if i exceed this i have to pay taxes on everything earned and my parents lose child support, this is just not worth it

its not hard to hit this, if i work 2 shifts a week i get there by the end of the year, or i can work the entire summer and get 400 hours done early, it doesnt matter so much when i work

i dont know where ill work yet either, but regardless of what i do the pay is similar, the minimum is 14 euros an hour, most of them are about 15-16, if i get night shifts its more 17-18

<div>
<input type=checkbox id=check-b />
<label for=check-b class="large top-1 bot-1 bold inverse">home</label>
<span class="toggle bot-2">the other big thing is ill be moving out soon, i get the keys sunday March 26th, its a small room for students in a bigger house with 8 of these total, its got its own kitchen and bathroom, its quite nice

there will be 7 other students, i havent met any of them yet, all i know is im taking the spot of a girl who recently graduated and the landlord lady is very kind

im nervous, not about living alone but about living with the other students, theres some shared spaces and from what ive heard everyones pretty close

its far out of my comfort zone and idk how well ill adjust, but i need a new environment and im hoping this will do me good

rent is about 540 a month all bills included, a bit expensive but the location is great and i think the room is worth it

my parents will support me with 600 a month, roughly equal to the child support they receive for me including tax benefits, i think its a fair arrangement

i can also go to them for any help, i can use their car if i ask, i can ask them to wash my clothes, i can join dinner if i let them know, stuff like that, im not on my own

<div>
<input type=checkbox id=check-c />
<label for=check-c class="large top-1 bot-1 bold inverse">financial</label>
<span class="toggle bot-2">calculating all this (in euros), rounding down and taking safe estimates, gives something like this

i will make about 9k this year and my expenses will total at about 5k (125 a week, i hope that this is a very generous upper limit), which leaves me with 4k, or about 100 a week

besides that i still have your 5k from last summer and another 13k given to me by my family, basically a gift to all the children, i havent spent any of it before and i dont consider it deserved, but its mine

i have to pay a guarantee of 1k on the place and if i have to pay my tuition next year thats another 1k, so to be safe lets say its 10k i can spend

this money doesnt do me any good, its far more than i need and its nothing i want, please let me know if it can mean anything to you

<div>
<input type=checkbox id=check-d />
<label for=check-d class="large top-1 bot-1 bold inverse">personal</label>
<span class="toggle bot-2">i havent really said why im moving out yet, im turning 21 this summer and i will be graduating with a big fancy degree in a little under 2 years so its not unreasonable, but i dont mind living in my parents house for now and theyd prefer me staying for a bit longer too

its just that i cant stand to be around my parents any longer, theyre not bad people but i simply cant communicate with them, they try to adjust to me but they dont understand how, i try to adjust to them but they cant see that

it causes a lot of friction, it upsets me and it doesnt do them any good either, maybe things will get better when i move out but i dont think im ever going to connect with them

my heads been a mess lately, i feel like im spiralling, ive been pushing myself into this hole and i dont know why and i wont stop

it doesnt have to be bad, maybe its just change, but i dont know where all of this is headed and ive been struggling with it, things should settle down a bit once ive moved in

<div>
<input type=checkbox id=check-e />
<label for=check-e class="large top-1 bot-1 bold inverse">updates</label>
<span class="toggle bot-2">i think i will be leaving some small updates here, about the work i end up choosing or how moving in went or whatever else happens

you can see if i did an update by date top right and a new blue header, i will do the first update by April 3rd, even if i dont have anything to say

of course, i dont expect you to check in on these at all, but just in case, give you the option, ... you know

if youve read this far i really hope you dont mind me doing this, please let me know if you do, i dont expect you to respond otherwise
